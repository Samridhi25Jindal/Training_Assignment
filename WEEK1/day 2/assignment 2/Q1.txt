1. How to apply style to first letter of the paragraph?
   We can use the <span> tag which is an inline element to apply style only on the first element and there won't be any
   line break and we can style the first letter of the text in the span element by choosing the CSS file the tag name and apply the properties.
   For eg:
  
   HTML FILE

	<p>
        <span>T</span>his page demonstrates how apply styles to tables and other html tag.
  	</p>


   CSS FILE

	span{
            font-style:bold;
            font-style:italic;
            color:red;
            font-size:100px;
        }


     OR we can use the CSS Property
            ::first-letter {
                }
