In general, HTTP cookies are used by websites to store user data locally and on the server side in order to make individual functions and web applications such as online 
shops, social networks, and forums more user-friendly.

Cookies allow a website to link your requests together, allowing it to recognise that the same person signed in, added an item to the shopping cart, browsed products, and then returned to the basket. Without cookies, the website would simply see four individual requests; but, if cookies are used, the website can see that the same person made all four requests and determine whose user account it belongs to. You probably won't be able to log into websites or utilise many other common functions if you don't have cookies enabled.

d. For the website owner cookies help them understand how many visits the website has had, any unique visitors, devices used, 
pages seen, and how long you spent on a page and your location.
