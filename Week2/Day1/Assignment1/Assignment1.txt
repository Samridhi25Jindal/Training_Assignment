1.Why do we use position property in CSS?
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.The CSS position property defines the position of an element in a document. This property works with the left, right, top, bottom and z-index properties to determine the final position of an element on a page.

There are five different position values:

a)static
b)relative
c)fixed
d)absolute
e)sticky

2.What is the difference between position property values :  absolute / relative;
Relative Position: Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of an element with position: relative; property will cause it to adjust from its normal position. The other objects or elements will not fill the gap.

Absolute Position: An element with position: absolute; will cause it to adjust its position with respect to its parent. If no parent is present, then it uses the document body as parent.
