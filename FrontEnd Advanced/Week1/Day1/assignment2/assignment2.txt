2. What is the difference between undefined and not defined in JavaScript?
undefined: It is a JavaScript keyword that has a special meaning. Everything which gets a space in memory will contain undefined until we assign a value to that memory space.It works like when we declared a variable in the code but did not assign the value before printing the variable value.
not defined: In JavaScript, it is one of the reference errors that JavaScript will throw when someone accesses the variable which is not inside the memory heap.It works like when we did not declare the variable and try to call that variable.


3. Difference between ==  and ===?
Double equals (==) is a comparison operator, which transforms the operands having the same type before comparison.
So, when you compare string with a number, JavaScript converts any string to a number. An empty string is always converts to zero. A string with no numeric value is converts to NaN (Not a Number), which returns false.

=== (Triple equals) is a strict equality comparison operator in JavaScript, which returns false for the values which are not of a similar type. This operator performs type casting for equality. If we compare 2 with “2” using ===, then it will return a false value.

4. What does the isNaN() function?
The JavaScript isNaN() Function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It returns true if the 
value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number.isNaN() Method.
