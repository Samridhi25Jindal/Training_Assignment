In Javascript, popup boxes are used to display the message or notification to the user. There are three types of pop-up boxes in JavaScript namely 
-->Alert Box
-->Confirm Box 
-->Prompt Box.

Alert Box: It is used when a warning message is needed to be produced. When the alert box is displayed to the user, the user needs to press ok and proceed. We use the alert() method of the window object to show an alert dialog box in JavaScript.

Prompt Box: It is a type of pop up box which is used to get the user input for further use. After entering the required details user have to click ok to proceed next stage else by pressing the cancel button user returns the null value.We use the prompt() method of the window object in JavaScript to take input from the user. The prompt() method takes two parameters: the message you want to display and the default value. The value returned by prompt() is stored in a variable and used to execute some action.


Confirm Box: It is a type of pop-up box that is used to get authorization or permission from the user. The user has to press the ok or cancel button to proceed. It returns true if the user clicks on the “OK” button, otherwise, then false is returned. In JavaScript, we use the window’s object confirm() method to take consent from the user.
