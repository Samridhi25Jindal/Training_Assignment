1. What is Single Responsibilty Principle?
The Single Responsibility Principle is the first principle of SOLID principles. It is the fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that determines how we should design classes.

The Single Responsibility Principle states that:
Each software module should have one and only one reason to change.

In other words, a class should have only one responsibility and therefore it should have only one reason to change its code. If a class has more than one responsibility, then there will be more than one reason to change the class (code).
