2. What is Asynchronous?
In general Asynchronous JavaScript lets the code execute immediately without blocking.Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous. Asynchronous JavaScript programming makes it possible to express waiting for long-running actions without freezing the program during these actions. JavaScript environments typically implement this style of programming using callbacks; functions that are called when an action completes.
