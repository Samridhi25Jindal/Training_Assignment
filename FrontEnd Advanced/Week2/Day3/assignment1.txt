1.  How to hide html element using JavaScript?
Hiding an HTML element can be performed in different ways in JavaScript.The three most popular ways of doing it are âˆ’
a)Using the hidden property
We can toggle between hiding and showing the element by setting the hidden attribute value to true or false, respectively.
Syntax: document.getElementById('element').hidden = true

b)Using the style.display property
We have two properties in the style object to hide the HTML element, one is the display, and another one is the visibility.
The main difference between these two is when we use style.visibility property, then the specific tag is not visible, but the space of the tag is still allocated. 
Whereas in style.display property, not only is the tag hidden but also there is no space allocated to that element.
Syntax: document.getElementById('element').style.display = 'none'

c)Using the style.visibility
Syntax:
      function hide() {
         document.getElementById('dip').style.visibility = 'hidden';
      }
      function show() {
         document.getElementById('dip').style.visibility = 'visible';
