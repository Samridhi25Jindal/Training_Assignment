broken layout

3.What is spinner class? How to create spinners in bootstrap?
Bootstrap “spinners” can be used to show the loading state in your projects. They’re built only with HTML and CSS, meaning 
you don’t need any JavaScript to create them.Their appearance, alignment, and sizing can be easily customized with the amazing utility classes.

To create a spinner/loader, use the .spinner-border class.

Use any text color utilites to add a color to the spinner.

Use the .spinner-grow class if you want the spinner/loader to grow instead of "spin".

Use .spinner-border-sm or .spinner-grow-sm to create a smaller spinner.

For eg:-
--------
<div class="spinner-border text-primary" role="status">
  <span class="visually-hidden">Loading...</span>
</div>
